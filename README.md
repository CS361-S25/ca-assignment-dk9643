This project is a browser-based continuous cellular automaton (CCA) built using the Empirical C++ web toolkit. Each cell holds a floating-point value between 0 and 1 and is visualized as a grayscale square on a toroidal grid. The automaton evolves using a sigmoid-based rule inspired by SmoothLife, where each cell updates based on the average of its neighbors. The system has been tuned to reach a stable blinking pattern, where the entire grid alternates between two distinct states indefinitely, forming a smooth period-2 oscillator. This project was assisted by AI in order to figure out the rule set and general coding as well. AI was also used to generate the documentation over the code.
